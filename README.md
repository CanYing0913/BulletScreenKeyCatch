This is a catcher based on user-defined keywords on input txt files.
It will generate a new output txt file giving lists of defined keywords and the lines associated with those keywords.
The linear search algorithm adopted here is z algorithm, credit given UIUC CS296-25 course material as a code outline with my own details.
